### React Native Application

## Done

- Applicant should build an application for messaging.
- The server is not necessary. You can use mocked data.
- The app should show the user list of messages. T
- The message list should be divided by date headers. Each header should represent a single day following by the messages of that day.
- The list should scroll (and begin) from the bottom to the up as many popular chat applications do.
- If the user has scrolled to several older messages, the app should show a button with animation to scroll to the latest message. By pressing that button the app should scroll with animation to the latest message.
- The Keyboard shouldn't cover the input.
- The app should behave the same on both iOS and Android.
- The app should match styles (colors may be different) of examples (see video and screenshots below).

## Todo

- The user should be able to swipe the whole view left to see each message timestamp (like Instagram on Android, for example, do).\*
